Description

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. SQL lends itself well to intuitive and clearly-defined databases, because it uses a system to create relationships among its data sets that is relatively easy to get started with. Companies use SQL when they have a need to store, update and serve data with clearly-defined relationships or using mature, proven technology.

In this lab, you will practice the basics of SQL by connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server instance and then creating, managing and viewing data using a combination of user interface tools and SQL queries.

Take in mind that if you end the session (or it terminates due to timeout) all your progress will be lost.
